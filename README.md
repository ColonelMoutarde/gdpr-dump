# GdprDump

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/smile/gdpr-dump/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/smile/gdpr-dump)
![Build Status](https://github.com/Smile-SA/gdpr-dump/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

This tool provides a command that dumps the contents of a MySQL and PostgresSql databases.

It is the equivalent of mysqldump, with additional features, at the cost of performance (PHP implementation).
The main purpose of this tool is to create anonymized dumps, in order to comply with GDPR regulations.

Features:

- Data converters (transform the data before it is dumped to the file).
- Recursive table filtering.
- Tables whitelist (only these tables will be included in the dump).
- Tables blacklist (not included in the dump).
- Dump options (compression, output type...).
- Predefined configuration templates (Magento, Drupal, OroCommerce).

## Documentation

The documentation (including installation instructions) is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/Smile-SA/gdpr-dump/wiki).

## FAQ

**Why don't you use Doctrine to generate the dump?**

The goal of Doctrine is to support a wide array of DBMS.
It does not support features that are specific to some databases.

For example, in MySQL, it is possible to create an index on BLOB columns.
There is a restriction though, you need to specify the length of the index.

This feature is used in Magento 2.
Since Doctrine does not support this feature, it cannot be used to create a working dump file of a Magento 2 database.
The following error would trigger during the import of the generated dump file:

```
ERROR 1170 (42000) at line 254: BLOB/TEXT column 'code' used in key specification without a key length
```

Also, the schema manager of Doctrine can only manage tables.
It does not handle triggers, procedures, views...

As a consequence, we don't use Doctrine to generate the dump file.
The dump file is generated with [MySQLDump-PHP](https://github.com/druidfi/mysqldump-php) instead, which is only compatible with MySQL.
